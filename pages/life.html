      Welcome to my first website guys! Hope y'all ike it, sure took me a lot of
      time to make it!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hi guys, this is Ji Wu, please call me Jon or Jonathan, I'm originally
      from Mongolia and have been in the states for 6 years now, looking forward
      to learning all about programming and meeting so many study buddies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am an English literature major and have a Master in Public
      Administration, worked in Marketing, Management, Nonprofit and Tech; and
      can't wait for this new challenge to start!
    </p>

    <p>
      I love Sci-Fi movies and do some stand-up in my free time; Mad Max: Fury
      Road is my favorite movie in this decade, Dan Harmon is my most admired
      storyteller alive, and Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary is my most recent
      obsession, ask me about them!
    </p>
