        Jon is learning how to use html and he's running out of things to type
        for he's exercises
      </h1>
      <h2>
        So he decised to just type out whatever is on his mind, kinda smart
        really
      </h2>
      <h4>
        He was just checking he's email for no reason at all for 5 minutes
        striaght, no, you don't need a app for bit-coin investment, you don't
        even have money for your healthcare, focus.

        You know, writing is quite therapeutic, I wonder if I can make a living
        just doing this.

      <p>
        No you can't, you tried that 10 years ago you pile of failure, and you
        can't spell failure without looking it up, programming is the path we
        are taking, six figure income, hello! Why do you think you are tying
        into an IDE instead of a loud typewriter along with every other hipster
        lives in Somerville

      This part is just for a ID selector, I'll put something funny here if I
      have time, apologies.
    </p>
    <p id="words2">
      Gezzz,took me 5 minutes to realize the reason that ID didn't is because of
      a typo, I now understand programmers' hatreds towards debugging. But it's
      working now, 1 and 0s, I control YOU! I have the power! I am a Golden
      God!!
